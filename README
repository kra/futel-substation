## futel-substation

This project has several components. Some share hosts, sometimes by assuming that other components are running on the same host.

Currently, we run backupbox and cmdlineclient on eurydice.

Currently, we don't run mechaoperator or logpublisher.

## Test mechaoperator from src/mechaoperator directory:

npm install mocha sinon
npm install q sqlite3 moment irc
node_modules/.bin/mocha test/test_info.js
node_modules/.bin/mocha test/test_client.js
# smoke tests to eyeball results of
node test/manual_test_info.js
cp ../conf/secrets.js secrets.js
node test/manual_test_snspoller.js
